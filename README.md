## üë©‚Äçüíª Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You can read the classes listed in the table of contents, but if you want to follow along, you need to install [CMake](https://cmake.org/) to build the project, and a C++ compiler which handles C++17.

#### Linux

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake
```

#### Windows

To get the MSVC compiler, you need to install [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (and not VSCode), and select C++ development during installation.

### Build on desktop

You can handle the `CMakeLists.txt` in any way you like, here's some way to use it :

#### `Option 1: CLI`

Go to the folder of this project and run :

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

#### `Option 2: Visual Studio (Windows only)`

Open this folder with the `CMake...` option in file->open on Visual Studio, and run the project.

#### `Option 3: VSCode`

Use the `CMakeTools` plugin, build with `f7` then run with `f5` (But be careful to be on the right platform, there is a launch file for windows and for linux).
